/**
 * Adds a "Simpan ke Unduhan" (Save to Downloads) entry to the book detail
 * overflow menu and exports the book to the public Downloads folder.
 *
 * How it works:
 *  1. {@code BookDetailAct.onCreateOptionsMenu} is patched to call
 *     {@code BookExporter.addExportMenuItem(activity, menu)}, which registers a
 *     menu item that requests an export and then triggers the app's own
 *     download flow ({@code BookDetailAct.O()}) for the currently shown book.
 *  2. {@code Liq.a} (the reader-intent builder) is patched to call
 *     {@code BookExporter.maybeExport(context, file, password, title)} right
 *     before the PDF/EPUB reader is launched. At that point BookLoadingAct has
 *     already downloaded and decrypted the book, so this hook has everything:
 *     the readable file, the decrypted book password (PDF only) used to unlock
 *     the PDF, and the book title for the filename.
 *
 * The file is written through MediaStore.Downloads so it works on scoped
 * storage (Android 10+) without any storage permissions. PDF files are
 * re-saved without the DRM password using the app's own Radaee PDF engine.
